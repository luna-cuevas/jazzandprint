A client reached out requesting an update to their website design. The website is hosted on a php-based CMS called printerbridge. Due to the limited documentation and community for the CMS, it took some time to find a development workflow. Considering that the CMS doesn't offer a development environemnet, a lot of my workflow included looking through chrome dev tools to snipe (edit/delete) css and php code. 

Despite these limitation, I was able to develop on chrome tools and then save my progress on these files here. I would then copy/paste my pre-compiled css into the head widget of the web app. For PHP modifications, this required reaching out the printerbridge team to find where the header and web page files were located. 

After some time developing after work, usually 2-3 hours per day. The completed result satisfied the client and I was able to optimize SEO ratings from 22% to 91% in a matter of 4 weeks. I'm currently still working with this client, ensuring that their needs have been met and that their customers are able to use the website well.
